      <p>The previous March 2026 metrics have been retired. They measured an unpinned recall pipeline that transformed provider scores and blended them with retrieval and recency signals, so they did not isolate reranker quality.</p>

      <p><strong>nDCG@10</strong> rewards annotated evidence near the top, relative to the ideal ranking. <strong>MRR</strong> averages the reciprocal rank of the first annotated evidence passage. <strong>Recall@K</strong> is the fraction of all annotated evidence passages recovered in the first K; <strong>Hit@1</strong> is the fraction of queries whose first passage is annotated evidence.</p>
      <p>BM25 and pinned BGE-base embeddings produce a fixed top-100 list by reciprocal rank fusion. Gold evidence is never inserted into the candidate pool. Retrieval misses count as zero. LoCoMo evidence IDs receive only syntax normalization; missing annotations and unresolved references are listed in the fixture. LoCoMo labels may omit other useful passages.</p>
      <p>SciFact has two different relevance definitions. Standard BEIR qrels credit the papers cited by a claim&apos;s source sentence, including papers without annotated evidence. The evidence view instead credits only explicitly annotated supporting or contradicting abstracts and excludes all 112 queries with no such annotations. Both views use identical recorded rankings; neither is an unseen holdout.</p>
      <p>Local models run on an RTX PRO 5000 Blackwell GPU in bfloat16, with batch size 32 and three warmup batches. Hosted models run from the same machine. Latency covers the whole candidate pool and includes client queueing, pacing, and retries; Jev uses separate pointwise Noul requests with bounded concurrency. This measures the recorded configuration, not each provider&apos;s maximum throughput.</p>
      <p>API cost uses reported usage and a verified list rate where available. Local compute and unverified rates are left unpriced. Confidence intervals resample whole conversations for LoCoMo and individual queries for SciFact; they describe sampling uncertainty and cannot account for incomplete labels or training contamination.</p>
